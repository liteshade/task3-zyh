We walk on the earth, our feet touching the ground with each step. The ground is solid, a foundation for all that stands. We build on the ground, creating homes and cities. The ground supports us, as does the earth that holds it. The earth spins in space, a blue-green sphere surrounded by the vast sky. The sky is above us, stretching out in all directions, reaching to the horizon and beyond.
